Project:Make a clone of https://brilliant-shortbread-b9a327.netlify.app/



sugarcosmetics is an Indian company of cosmetics products. It is one of the leading company or a brand which intends to make lives of mums & expectant mums better and beautiful. India has a growing market demand for cosmetics. People struggle to find the right shade and product and often switch to big foreign brands.

In this project we have tried to manipulate dom elements, styling using css and tried to make a dynamic and responsive website. With our efforts and the technology stack, that we have learned till now in Unit-4 in the Masai school, we were able to clone more or less the whole website with same looking and features.

# Technolgy Stack Used ðŸŒŸ

# End Notes  ðŸ“‘
In this project we have tried to achieve a near to perfect clone of the original website as much as possible. This entire journey of this construct week has given us experiences and we have learned lots of things by applying to the real website and it gave us a lot of confidence. Most of the features are added and functionality of the website is achieved.

# Limitations 

All pages are not responsive yet, pages are not properly visible on small screen devices as we were having only 6 days to complete the project.
